# Testing

Currently it is still impossible to set your own password and file location. Also, new file, where passwords will be stored is not automatically generated.

For testing purposes create new file in `settings.data_location` folder, which is printed out when the app is launched. On linux it should look like this (you will probably have to make `ElectronPass` folders by yourself too):

    /home/{username}/.local/share/ElectronPass/ElectronPass/electronpass.wallet

And paste this string into file (one line only!):
